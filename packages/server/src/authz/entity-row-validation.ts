/**
 * The entity-row VALIDATION seam.
 *
 * `patchEntityRows` is the single physical writer for entity rows (the
 * `check-entity-write-funnel` gate proves no raw entity SQL lives outside
 * `entity-management.ts`). It is therefore the only place every write
 * converges, and the only place a state invariant can be enforced without
 * depending on 20-odd callers each remembering to ask.
 *
 * Enforcement is structural rather than conventional: `patchEntityRows` accepts
 * only a {@link ValidatedEntityRowPatch}, which this module alone can mint. A
 * caller that forgets to validate does not slip through — it fails to compile.
 *
 * Two reasons validation lives HERE and not in `runMutationGate`:
 *
 *  1. The gate answers a PERMISSION question (may this principal write this
 *     field) and is keyed on `principalKind` + ownership. Validation answers
 *     "is the resulting state legal", which has no principal in it.
 *  2. The gate runs BEFORE approval-held fields are stripped and before the
 *     ownership merge rewrites the patch. It therefore judges a proposal, not
 *     what commits. This seam sees the effective patch — the exact bytes about
 *     to hit the table — so it cannot be fooled by either transformation.

/**
 * The GRANTING validator: the only way to waive an escalation.
 *
 * Takes the fields a human already approved — taken from the proposal that
 * minted their card — and REQUIRES them (no default), so an ordinary write path
 * that never validates against them fails to compile rather than silently
 * waiving.
 *
 * Without this, escalation is a dead end: approving re-runs the same rule
 * against the same state, it escalates again, and the write throws — so the
 * approval a rule asked for could never be honoured.
 *
 * SCOPED, not a blanket waiver. A mode flag would wave through every escalate
 * the rule can raise, including one raised for the first time after the card
 * was minted (a redeployed rule, a moved row) — consent to a field nobody
 * reviewed. Only fields actually on the card are covered; a new escalation
 * needs its own card. A `deny` still throws regardless: approval cannot make
 * an illegal state legal. When an escalate is NOT covered, the thrown error
 * names the approved fields and the rule's requested ones side by side, so an
 * unapproved skip cannot pass in silence.
 *
 * GRANTING is a module-boundary property: only the approval apply path (the
 * module that routed a card) and the entity write kernel that forwards a grant
 * may import this. Enforced by `scripts/check-security-patterns.sh`. Known
 * ceiling: TypeScript has no module-private, so grep is the strongest available
 * enforcement, and the script's allowlist/exemption list can be edited.
 *
 * Same handle/#2818 contract as {@link validateEntityRowPatch}: only the
 * caller's transaction handle, never `getDb()` — because a read on one pooled
 * connection followed by a write on another can be overtaken in between.
 *
 * The single exception is a caller that WRITES NOTHING: `deleteEntity`'s dry
 * run passes the pool deliberately, because a preview enforces nothing and so
 * has no check for a concurrent write to overtake. If a call can commit, it
 * owes this function a transaction.
 *
 * Rows are grouped by their type's compiled rule so each distinct rule runs in
 * ONE isolate over its whole group. Per-row isolates do not scale — measured at
 * ~300 evals/sec, or ~21s for a 5,000-row sync, against ~29.7ms for the same
 * rows batched (see `entity-rule-executor.ts` for the full curve).
 *
 * @throws EntityRowValidationError when a rule denies the write, when a rule
 * crashes or times out (fail closed: a rule that did not finish cannot bless a
 * write), when it returns an unusable verdict, or when it escalates fields the
 * caller has not been granted.
